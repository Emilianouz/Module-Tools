'''
Write a program which:
1.Already has a list of Laptops that a library has to lend out.
2.Accepts user input to create a new Person - it should use the input function to 
read a person's name, age, and preferred operating system.
3.Tells the user how many laptops the library has that have that operating system.
4.If there is an operating system that has more laptops available, tells the user 
that if they're willing to accept that operating system they're more likely to get a laptop.

You should convert the age and preferred operating system input from the user 
into more constrained types as quickly as possible, and should output errors to 
stderr and terminate the program with a non-zero exit code if the user input bad values.
